# Emotion-Recognition

We have implemeted a model to derive the emotion of a person from their speech. This model was implemented using the CREMA-D dataset.

CREMA-D is a data set of 7,442 original clips from 91 actors. These clips were from 48 male and 43 female actors between the ages of 20 and 74 coming from a variety of races and ethnicities (African America, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Unspecified).

We have implemented this model on Google colab by using the dataset imported from Kaggle.
